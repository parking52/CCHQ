Perfect
Teeth
Steven
want
to
be
a
dentist
.
it
be
pretty
much
the
first
thing
he
tell
we
when
,
as
first
year
,
we
be
all
bunched
together
in
the
unfamiliar
dusty
classroom
.
when
,
a
couple
of
week
late
we
be
invite
over
to
his
house
we
see
that
this
be
not
a
idle
remark
.
where
our
bedroom
wall
be
decorate
with
poster
of
pop
star
and
footballer
,
Steven
have
diagram
set
out
tooth
implementation
,
anatomical
drawing
of
the
jaw
with
brightly
coloured
nerve
,
muscle
,
blood
vessel
,
bone
,
and
,
of
course
,
tooth
.
where
we
have
shelf
of
plastic
dinosaur
and
superhero
figurine
from
cornflake
box
,
Steven
have
plaster
cast
of
jawbone
,
gum
and
tooth
grin
down
at
we
.
the
instrument
be
lock
away
in
glass
cabinet
and
only
his
parent
have
the
key
.
"
they
do
not
exactly
encourage
my
interest
,
"
he
shrug
.
"
they
sort
of
tolerate
it
.
but
Dad
say
they
be
a
sort
of
collection
,
and
too
expensive
for
I
to
play
with
.
"
of
course
,
we
try
to
pick
the
lock
,
but
the
spike
and
saw
and
drillheads
remain
—
tantalisingly
—
out
of
reach
.
we
do
not
see
Steven
's
interest
as
strange
,
well
,
not
that
much
.
we
all
have
our
own
interest
—
draw
,
electronics
,
collect
beer
cap
—
that
each
appear
obscure
to
anyone
else
.
DIY
dentistry
be
just
something
that
have
never
cross
our
horizon
before
.
and
if
Steven
do
not
see
it
as
weird
,
or
no
weird
than
Andy
show
we
his
Eastern-Block
beer
cap
all
lay
out
neatly
on
cork
board
with
little
hand-written
label
,
why
should
it
bother
we
?
I
suppose
that
,
in
our
own
way
,
we
be
all
collectively
strange
.
the
bunch
that
no
one
pick
for
their
side
at
football
or
hockey
,
and
that
be
the
glue
that
hold
we
together
.
besides
,
Steven
have
some
really
good
stuff
:
sweet
that
stain
your
tooth
bright
red
—
well
,
technically
,
not
your
tooth
,
just
the
plaque
,
but
the
result
be
often
the
same
.
it
take
a
few
day
good
brush
to
get
it
off
.
well
,
most
of
it
anyway
.
he
have
effervescent
tablet
that
turn
the
canteen
drinking
water
into
that
exact
same
pink
mixture
that
the
dentist
give
you
to
rinse
your
mouth
out
after
scrape
around
inside
,
and
guarantee
to
make
the
other
kid
splutter
and
spit
it
out
when
the
taste
slowly
percolate
through
and
meet
the
memory
of
their
last
checkup
.
then
there
be
the
event
that
become
the
rite
of
passage
into
our
group
of
misfit
and
outcast
:
make
a
mould
of
your
tooth
.
it
be
inevitable
that
one
of
we
,
see
the
plaster
cast
on
the
shelf
by
Steven
's
bed
would
ask
how
they
be
do
.
it
be
just
as
inevitable
that
a
few
minute
late
,
Steven
would
be
mix
up
various
powder
and
liquid

I

why
do
you
choose
to
run
in
the
Republican
Party
?
my
ty
to
the
Republican
party
date
back
to
1979
,
when
I
volunteer
for
Ronald
Reagan
and
his
campaign
in
New
Hampshire
.
in
those
day
I
believe
there
be
a
difference
in
the
party
.
today
,
like
many
Americans
,
I
be
skeptical
.
I
understand
third
party
candidate
have
no
success
.
I
hope
to
lead
the
Republican
party
in
a
new
direction
for
working
class
Americans
.
how
do
you
plan
to
get
into
the
Republican
debate
and
make
a
impact
on
poll
?
in
order
to
be
invite
to
the
debate
,
we
must
raise
money
and
poll
nationally
.
this
be
a
effort
that

recently
we
be

in

if
you

not
receive
the

as
a
third

candidate
?
no
,
I
will
back
the
nominee
of
the
Republican

in
2016
.
after
that
,
I
may
reconsider
.
other
than
yourself
,
which
candidate
have
you
support
for
president
in
previous
campaign
?
Reagan

80
and
84
,
[

92
,
[
Phil

Gramm
in
96
,
[
George
W.

Bush
in

,

.
What
be
your
thought
on
the
job
Barack
Obama
have
do
as
president
?
specifically
,
what
would
you
have
do
differently
?
President
Obama
have
a
agenda
that
represent
the
far
leave
wing
of
his
party
.
his
use
of
the
Presidency
to
further
this
agenda
have
in
many
way
be
unconstitutional
.
specifically
,
alter
law
once
it
be
pass
to
accommodate
his
voting
bloc
.
his
direction
to
Eric
Holder
to
enforce
some
law
and
not
other
be
another
example
.
Hill
at
the
Lesser-known
candidate
forum
in
2011
if
elect
,
what
would
constitute
a
successful
presidency
for
you
?
achieve
four
goal
:
term
limit
for
Congress
and
the

to
the
people
.
implement
a
tax
system

What
individual
would
you
like
to
see
in
a

I
would
like
to
bring
people
from
the

anything
else

would
like
to
add
?
a
final
thought
.

interview
what
be
the
most
important
aspect
of
your
background
that
voter
should
know
about
?
I
be
the
only
candidate
bear
and
raise
in
Virginia
,
but
also
the
only
candidate
who
embody
both
physically
and
philosophically
the
grow
diversity
of
the
commonwealth
.
(
I
be
mixed-race
(
half-Chinese
)
and
in
a
interracial
marriage
.
)
I
be
the
only
candidate
who
have
study
both
economics
and
law
,
and
the
only
candidate
with
a
background
in
technology
entrepreneurship
.
because
of
my
academic
and
professional
background
,
I
understand
the
issue
and
challenge
face
Virginia
much
well
than
the
other
candidate
,
and
I
be
offer
real
solution
that
can
be
appreciate
across
the
political
spectrum
.
I
be
the
only
candidate
who
believe
in
both
economic
freedom
and
personal
liberty
and
the
only
candidate
who
stand
on
principle
against
cronyism
and
corporatism
and
in
favor
of
the
rule
of
law
.
what
be
your
thought
on
the
job
Bob
McDonnell
have
do
as
Governor
of
Virginia
?
what
would
you
have
do
differently
than
he
?
McDonnell
do
well
early
in
his
term
push
back
against
Senate
Democrats
who
want
huge
tax
increase
in
response
to
major
revenue
shortfall
during
the
recession
.
those
early
budget
effort
be
his
high
achievement
as
Governor
.
more
recently
,
he
err
in
accept
a
transportation
bill
that
have
huge
flaw
and
huge
tax
increase
,
rather
than
prioritizing
spending
and
seek
more
rational
,
efficient
,
decentralized
transportation
decision-making
.
he
could
have
show
much
great
leadership
in
push
for
tax
reform
,
regulatory
reform
,
and
school
choice
.
of
course
,
he
show
ethical
lapse
in
judgment
.
compare
to
previous
third
party
candidate
at
the
gubernatorial
level
,
you
have
do
exceptionally
well
in
opinion
polling
.
what
do
you
attribute
that
success
to
?
voter
see
the
two-party
system
for
the
sham
it
have
become
.
they
be
sick
of
the
partisanship
and
nonsense
and
the
total
lack
of
substance
in
modern

.
voter
see
the
two
major

nominee
as
exemplify
what
be
bad
about
their

party
,
and
they
want
something
well
.
voter
who
meet
I
and
hear
I
speak
know
that
I
be
sincere
,
know
that
I
understand
the
issue
deeply
and
have
workable
solution
,
and
know
that
I
stand
on
principle
against
cronyism
and
corporatism
and
in
favor
of
the
rule
of

and
the
public

people
like
the
fact
that
I

if
elect
governor
,
how
will
you
be
able
to
implement
your
agenda
while
deal
with
a
hostile
legislature
?
there
be
precedent
of
independent
governor
deal
effectively
with
the
legislature
,
and
indeed
a
wise
third-party
governor
can
have
great
effectiveness
than
a
major
party
governor
.
libertarian
share
many
policy
position
with
each
of
the
major

.
work
together
with
both
Republicans
and
Democrats
,
we
can
get
the
good
aspect
of
each
party
while
reject
the
bad
part
of
both
.
moreover
,
elect
a
third-party
governor
represent
a
repudiation
of
politics
as
usual
,
and
the
major

will
face

why

take
the
acoustic
fate
of

work
into
your
own
hand
,
and
how
do
you
go
about
it
?
I
think
that
a
vibrant
public
domain
be
very
important
to
a
healthy
world
,
and
so
I
think
:
here
be
a
way
to
help
the
cause
.
I
launch
LibriVox
,
emailed
some
friend
and
some
podcasters
who

,
and
invite
they
to

have
grow
steadily
since
.
by
the
way
,
AKMA
be
the
first
guy
I
know
of
to
do
something
like
this
,
with
Lawrence
Lessig
's
Free
Culture
.
that
,
I
think
,
start
my
thinking
about
this
,
but
it
take
a
while
for
the
idea
to
crystallize
.
Hugh
McGuire

some

not
yet

do
you
personally
record

,
and
do
you
already
do
so
before
LibriVox
?
LibriVox
be
my
first
experience
recording
audiobooks
.
I
still
do
the
odd
chapter
,
but
I
be
a
bit
delinquent
in
finish
some
of
they
these
day
!
be
there
a
particular
LibriVox

you

stand
out
because
of
the
quality
,
the
overall
effort

,
its
popularity

for
some

I
find
that
the
quality
of
the
speak
audio
vary
greatly
from
text
to
text
or
even
from
chapter
to
chapter
.
if
someone
want
to
re-record
a
chapter
because
they
do
not
like
the
speaker
,
would
you
then
offer
two
version
?
yes
.
we
take
the
Wikipedia
approach
:
if
you
think
it
should
be
good
,
please
help
it
be
so
.
you
will
note
we
offer
a
couple
of
version
of
some
book
.
indeed
our
weekly

project
celebrate
this
diversity
of

:
each

a
new
short
poem

and
as
many
reader
as
wish
to
record
a

,
so
you
get
20
+
version
of
the
same
poem
,
a
very
interesting
audio
experience
.

this
need
more
discussion
obviously
:
we
choose

because
the

we

well

fine
with

we

also
,
for

Perfect
Teeth
Steven
want
to
be
a
dentist

it
be
pretty
much
the
first
thing
he
tell
we
when

as

we
be
all
bunched
together
in

unfamiliar
dusty
classroom

when
,
a
couple
of
week
late
we
be
invite
over
to
his
house
we
see
that
this
be
not
a
idle
remark
.
where
our
bedroom
wall
be
decorate
with

of
pop
star
and

Steven
have

set
out

drawing
of
the
jaw
with
brightly
coloured
nerve
,
muscle
,
blood
vessel
,
bone
,
and
,
of
course
,
tooth
.
where
we
have
shelf
of
plastic
dinosaur
and
superhero
figurine
from
cornflake
box
,
Steven
have
plaster
cast
of
jawbone
,
gum
and
tooth
grin
down
at
we
.
the
instrument
be
lock
away
in
glass
cabinet
and
only
his
parent
have
the
key
.
"
they
do
not
exactly
encourage
my
interest
,
"
he
shrug
.
"
they
sort
of
tolerate
it
.
but
Dad
say
they
be
a
sort
of
collection
,
and
too
expensive
for
I
to
play
with
.
"
of
course
,
we
try
to
pick
the
lock
,
but
the
spike
and
saw
and
drillheads
remain
—
tantalisingly
—
out
of
reach
.
we
do
not
see
Steven
's
interest
as
strange
,
well
,
not
that
much
.
we
all
have
our
own
interest
—
draw
,
electronics
,
collect
beer
cap
—
that
each
appear
obscure
to
anyone
else
.
DIY
dentistry
be
just
something
that
have
never
cross
our
horizon
before

if
Steven
do
not
see
it
as
weird
,

no
weird
than
Andy
show
we
his
Eastern-Block
beer
cap
all
lay
out
neatly

should
it

for

the
glue
that
hold
we
together

,
Steven
have
some
really
good
stuff
:
sweet
that
stain
your
tooth
bright
red
—
well
,
technically
,
not
your
tooth
,
just
the
plaque
,
but
the
result
be
often
the
same
.
it
take
a
few
day
good
brush
to
get
it
off
.
well
,
most
of
it
anyway
.
he
have
effervescent
tablet
that
turn
the
canteen
drinking
water
into
that
exact
same
pink
mixture
that
the
dentist
give
you
to
rinse
your
mouth
out
after
scrape
around
inside
,
and
guarantee
to
make
the
other
kid
splutter
and
spit
it
out
when
the
taste
slowly
percolate
through
and
meet
the
memory
of
their
last
checkup
.
then
there
be
the
event
that
become
the
rite
of
passage
into
our
group
of
misfit
and
outcast
:
make
a
mould
of
your
tooth
.
it
be
inevitable
that
one
of
we
,
see
the
plaster
cast
on
the
shelf
by
Steven
's
bed
would
ask
how
they
be
do
.
it
be
just
as
inevitable
that
a
few
minute
late
,
Steven
would
be
mix
up
various
powder
and
liquid
,
and
pour
they
into
a
horse-shoe
shaped
contraption
.
it
be
not
dangerous
.
at
least
,
I
suppose
so
.
it
be
vaguely
uncomfortable
,
and
appear
sufficiently
disturbing
that
we
all
volunteer
each
other
in
turn
until
,
at
last
,
Andy
say
he
be
game
.
and
we
be
off
.
the
hard
part
be
probably
to
overcome
the
gag
reflex
that
set
in
when
you
bit
down
into
the
acrid
resin
jelly
and
it
flow
out
and
up
and
around
,
over
tooth
,
gum
and
tongue
.
your
nose
fill
with
what
you
imagine
be
fume
from
the
warm
paste
.
and
you
seem
to
be
suddenly
drown
in
your
own
saliva
.
thing
generally
get
good
when
Steven
remind
you
that
you
could
actually
breathe
,
and
swallow
,
normally
.
he
watch
the
second
hand
trot
round
the
dial
of
his
watch
mouth
the
quarter
,
before
poke
the
set
goo
to
check
its
consistency
.
then
,
when
he
give
you
the
nod
,
you
try
to
prise
your
jaw
apart
.
as
the
seal
around
your
gum
and
tooth
be
pretty
solid
,
you
think
it
would
never
come
off
,
as
the
other
giggle
at
your
expression
and
grimace
.
Steven
jiggle
the
handle
that
stick
out
beyond
your
front
tooth
like
some
metallic
duck
's
bill
,
turn
and
twist
it
most
professionally
and
murmur
encouragement
.
and
,
then
,
with
a
awful
suck
slurp
,
it
come
free
.
the
initiated
then
revel
in
retell
the
gross
sensation
of
have
this
evil-smelling
plastic
slug
invade
your
mouth
,
while
the
other
wait
their
turn
with
mixed
trepidation
and
excitement
.
raucous
laughter
greet
the
suggestion
of
the
other
body
part
that
could
receive
the
same
treatment
.
the
next
part
of
the
proceeding
be
less
thrilling
.
Steven
measure
and
mix
the
plaster
of
Paris
and
prepare
for
the
cast
by
use
a
bright
blue
putty
to
build
up
the
form
of
the
jaw
,
and
shore
up
gap
and
hole
.
it
get
even
less
exciting
when
he
say
we
will
have
to
wait
a
hour
while
the
plaster
set
real
solid
.
but
the
next
time
we
visit
his
room
we
get
to
marvel
at
our
toothy
grin
label
and
line
up
on
the
shelf
.
we
be
all
perfectly
happy
with
the
result
,
even
want
one
as
a
trophy
until
Steven
pass
a
expert
eye
over
they
,
point
out

a
gap
,
here
a
filling

and
there
a
completely
misaligned
incisor
.
we
be

he
tell

mediocre
specimen
for
his
collection

it
do
not

we
be

why

why
not

for
a
low

that
you
would
be
more
likely
to
win
and
effect

.
I
never

to
make
politics
a

.
why
do
you
choose
to
run
in
the
Republican
Party
?
my
ty
to
the
Republican
party
date
back
to
1979
,
when
I
volunteer
for
Ronald
Reagan
and
his
campaign
in
New
Hampshire
.
in
those
day
I
believe
there
be
a
difference
in
the
party
.
today
,
like
many
Americans
,
I
be
skeptical
.
I
understand
third
party
candidate
have
no
success
.
I
hope
to
lead
the
Republican
party
in
a
new
direction
for
working
class
Americans
.
how
do
you
plan
to
get
into
the
Republican
debate
and
make
a
impact
on
poll
?
in
order
to
be
invite
to
the
debate
,
we
must
raise
money
and
poll
nationally
.
this
be
a
effort
that
be
underway
.
recently
we
be
list
in
New
Hampshire
and
nationally
with
Politics1
.
if
you
do
not
receive
the
Republican
nomination
,
would
you
consider
run
as
a
third
party
candidate
?
no
,
I
will
back
the
nominee
of
the
Republican
party
in
2016
.
after
that
,
I
may
reconsider
.
other
than
yourself
,
which
candidate
have
you
support
for
president
in
previous
campaign
?
Reagan
in
80
and
84
,
[
George
H.
W.
]
Bush
in
88
and
92
,
[
Phil
]
Gramm
in
96
,
[
George
W.
]
Bush
in
2000
and
,
Romney
in
08
.
What
be
your
thought
on
the
job
Barack
Obama
have
do
as
president
?
specifically
,
what
would
you
have
do
differently
?
President
Obama
have
a
agenda
that
represent
the
far
leave
wing
of
his
party
.
his
use
of
the
Presidency
to
further
this
agenda
have
in
many
way
be
unconstitutional
.
specifically
,
alter
law
once
it
be
pass
to
accommodate
his
voting
bloc
.
his
direction
to
Eric
Holder
to
enforce
some
law
and
not
other
be
another
example
.
Hill
at
the
Lesser-known
candidate
forum
in
2011
if
elect
,
what
would
constitute
a
successful
presidency
for
you
?
achieve
four
goal
:
term
limit
for
Congress
and
the
court
return
government
to
the
people
.
implement
a
tax
system
that
allow
work
Americans
make
under
$
250000

keep
all
of
their
money

closing

.
return
America
to
a
state
of
peace
and
security
.
What
individual
would
you
like
to
see
in
a
Hill
administration
?
I
would
like
to
bring
people
from
the
heartland
of
America
that
make

anything
else
you
would
like
to
add
?
a
final
thought
.
America
be
a
nation
that
will
endure
.
I

interview
what
be
the
most
important
aspect
of
your
background
that
voter
should
know
about
?
I
be
the
only
candidate
bear
and
raise
in
Virginia
,
but
also
the
only
candidate
who
embody
both
physically
and
philosophically
the
grow
diversity
of
the
commonwealth
.
(
I
be
mixed-race
(
half-Chinese
)
and
in
a
interracial
marriage
.
)
I
be
the
only
candidate
who
have
study
both
economics
and
law
,
and
the
only
candidate
with
a
background
in
technology
entrepreneurship
.
because
of
my
academic
and
professional
background
,
I
understand
the
issue
and
challenge
face
Virginia
much
well
than
the
other
candidate
,
and
I
be
offer
real
solution
that
can
be
appreciate
across
the
political
spectrum
.
I
be
the
only
candidate
who
believe
in
both
economic
freedom
and
personal
liberty
and
the
only
candidate
who
stand
on
principle
against
cronyism
and
corporatism
and
in
favor
of
the
rule
of
law
.
what
be
your
thought
on
the
job
Bob
McDonnell
have
do
as
Governor
of
Virginia
?
what
would
you
have
do
differently
than
he
?
McDonnell
do
well
early
in
his
term
push
back
against
Senate
Democrats
who
want
huge
tax
increase
in
response
to
major
revenue
shortfall
during
the
recession
.
those
early
budget
effort
be
his
high
achievement
as
Governor
.
more
recently
,
he
err
in
accept
a
transportation
bill
that
have
huge
flaw
and
huge
tax
increase
,
rather
than
prioritizing
spending
and
seek
more
rational
,
efficient
,
decentralized
transportation
decision-making
.
he
could
have
show
much
great
leadership
in
push
for
tax
reform
,
regulatory
reform
,
and
school
choice
.
of
course
,
he
show
ethical
lapse
in
judgment
.
compare
to
previous
third
party
candidate
at
the
gubernatorial
level
,
you
have
do
exceptionally
well
in
opinion
polling
.
what
do
you
attribute
that
success
to
?
voter
see
the
two-party
system
for
the
sham
it
have
become
.
they
be
sick
of
the
partisanship
and
nonsense
and
the
total
lack
of
substance
in
modern
campaign
.
voter
see
the
two
major
party
nominee
as
exemplify
what
be
bad
about
their
respective
party
,
and
they
want
something
well
.
voter
who
meet
I
and
hear
I
speak
know
that
I
be
sincere
,
know
that
I
understand
the
issue
deeply
and
have
workable
solution
,
and
know
that
I
stand
on
principle
against
cronyism
and
corporatism
and
in
favor
of
the
rule
of
law
and
the
public
interest
.
people
like
the
fact
that
I
stand
for
a

both
open-minded
and

if
elect
governor
,
how
will
you
be
able
to
implement
your
agenda
while
deal
with
a
hostile
legislature
?
there
be
precedent
of
independent
governor
deal
effectively
with
the
legislature
,
and
indeed
a
wise
third-party
governor
can
have
great
effectiveness
than
a
major
party
governor
.
libertarian
share
many
policy
position
with
each
of
the
major

.
work
together
with
both
Republicans
and
Democrats
,
we
can
get
the
good
aspect
of
each
party
while
reject
the
bad
part
of
both
.
moreover
,
elect
a
third-party
governor
represent
a
repudiation
of
politics
as
usual
,
and
the
major

will
face

do
you

why
?

I
find
that
the
quality
of
the
speak
audio
vary
greatly
from
text
to
text
or
even
from
chapter
to
chapter
.
if
someone
want
to
re-record
a
chapter
because
they
do
not
like
the
speaker
,
would
you
then
offer
two
version
?
yes
.
we
take
the
Wikipedia
approach
:
if
you
think
it
should
be
good
,
please
help
it
be
so
.
you
will
note
we
offer
a
couple
of
version
of
some
book
.
indeed
our
weekly
poetry
project
celebrate
this
diversity
of
voice
:
each
week
a
new
short
poem
be
choose
and
as
many
reader
as
wish
to
record
a
version
,
so
you
get
20
+
version
of
the
same
poem
,
a
very
interesting
audio
experience
.
besides
work
whose
copyright
have
expire
,
there
be
a
increase
number
of

license
.
you
mention
Larry
Lessig
's

Culture
,
but
it
also
include
some
out
of

title
by
publisher
who
be
open
to
the
concept
,
such
as
O'Reilly
.
do
you
want
to
limit
the
scope
of
LibriVox
strictly
to
old
public
domain
work
,
or
do
you
have
plan
to
include
recent
work
under
reasonably
permissive
license
as
well
?
we
be
only
do
public
domain
work
,
for
a
number
of
reason
,
partly
to
keep
simplicity
in
our
copyright
situation
--
public
domain
mean
it
be
as
simple
as
can
be
.
CC
make
thing
more
complex
.
also
,
there
be
other
site
,
notably
podiobooks.com
,
which
be
well
suit
to
CC
work
than
LibriVox
.
we
find
it
make
thing
clear
and
easy
to
say
:
publish
work
,
public
domain
,
and
leave
it
at
that
.
as
far
as
I
can
tell
,
podiobooks.com
feature
"
free
as
in
beer
"
content
—
material
which
you
can
download
,
but
which
be
not
under
a
free
content
license
.
instead
of
"
public
domain
"
,
would
not
"
free
content
"
work
just
as
well
,
use
something
like
the
Free
content
definition
to
limit
the
scope
?
this
need
more
discussion
obviously
:
we
choose
public
domain
because
the
text
we
use
be
public
domain
and
we
do
not
want
to
add
new
restriction
,
especially
not
non-commercial
,
since
already
our
recording
be
be
use
for
a
number
of
commercialish
project
(
I
can
not
recall
any
specific
project
name
,
but
some
pay-education
site
use
LV
stuff
)
.
that
be
good
and
well
and
fine
with
we
.
we
do
not
want
to
have
to
give
anyone
permission
to
use
our
recording
,
we
want
anyone
to
use
they
for
whatever
they
want
.
also
,
for
the
thing
to
work
you
need
to
have
many
dedicated
volunteer
willing
to
do
the
management
(
onerous
)
and
many
willing
to
do
the
reading
.
while
Pride
and
prejudice
will
attract
many
reader
,
I
do
not
know
about
O'Reilly
's
late
tome
on
XML
...
though
I
might
be
wrong
.

of

try
to
pick
the

but
the
spike
and
saw
and

remain
—
tantalisingly
—
out

reach
.
we
do
not
see
Steven
's
interest
as
strange
,
well
,
not
that
much
.
we
all
have
our
own

,

—
that
each
appear

something

if
Steven
do
not
see
it
as

no

than
Andy

we

that
,
in

we
be
all

strange

no

that

the
glue
that

,
Steven
have
some
really
good
stuff
:
sweet
that
stain
your
tooth
bright
red
—
well
,
technically
,
not
your
tooth
,
just
the
plaque
,
but
the
result
be
often
the
same
.
it
take
a
few
day
good
brush
to
get
it
off
.
well
,
most
of
it
anyway
.
he
have

tablet
that
turn
the

drinking
water
into
that
exact

pink
mixture
that
the

give
you
to
rinse
your
mouth
out
after

around

,
and
guarantee
to
make
the
other
kid
splutter
and
spit
it
out
when
the
taste
slowly
percolate
through
and
meet
the
memory
of
their
last
checkup
.
then
there
be
the
event
that
become
the
rite
of
passage
into
our
group
of
misfit
and
outcast
:
make
a
mould
of
your
tooth
.
it
be
inevitable
that
one
of
we
,
see
the
plaster
cast
on
the
shelf
by
Steven
's
bed
would
ask
how
they
be
do
.
it
be
just
as
inevitable
that
a
few
minute
late
,
Steven
would
be
mix
up
various
powder
and
liquid
,
and
pour
they
into
a
horse-shoe
shaped
contraption
.
it
be
not
dangerous
.
at
least
,
I
suppose
so
.
it
be
vaguely
uncomfortable
,
and
appear
sufficiently
disturbing
that
we
all
volunteer
each
other
in
turn
until
,
at
last
,
Andy
say
he
be
game
.
and
we
be
off
.
the
hard
part
be
probably
to
overcome
the
gag
reflex
that
set
in
when
you
bit
down
into
the
acrid
resin
jelly
and
it
flow
out
and
up
and
around
,
over
tooth
,
gum
and
tongue
.
your
nose
fill
with
what
you
imagine
be
fume
from
the
warm
paste
.
and
you
seem
to
be
suddenly
drown
in
your

saliva

thing
generally
get
good
when
Steven
remind
you
that
you
could
actually
breathe
,
and
swallow
,
normally
.
he
watch
the
second
hand
trot
round
the
dial
of
his
watch
mouth
the
quarter
,
before
poke
the
set
goo
to
check
its
consistency
.
then
,
when
he
give
you
the
nod
,
you
try
to
prise
your
jaw
apart
.
as
the
seal
around
your
gum
and
tooth
be
pretty
solid
,
you
think
it
would
never
come
off
,
as
the
other
giggle
at
your
expression
and
grimace
.
Steven
jiggle
the
handle
that
stick
out
beyond
your
front
tooth
like
some
metallic
duck
's
bill
,
turn
and
twist
it
most
professionally
and
murmur
encouragement
.
and
,
then
,
with
a
awful
suck
slurp
,
it
come
free
.
the
initiated
then
revel
in
retell
the
gross
sensation
of
have
this
evil-smelling
plastic
slug
invade
your
mouth
,
while
the
other
wait
their
turn
with
mixed
trepidation
and
excitement
.
raucous
laughter
greet
the
suggestion
of
the
other
body
part
that
could
receive
the
same
treatment
.
the
next
part
of
the
proceeding
be
less
thrilling
.
Steven
measure
and
mix
the
plaster
of
Paris
and
prepare
for
the
cast
by
use
a
bright
blue
putty
to
build
up
the
form
of
the
jaw
,
and
shore
up
gap
and
hole
.
it
get
even
less
exciting
when
he
say
we
will
have
to
wait
a
hour
while
the
plaster
set
real
solid
.
but
the
next
time
we
visit
his
room
we
get
to
marvel
at
our
toothy
grin
label
and
line
up
on
the
shelf
.
we
be
all
perfectly
happy
with
the
result
,
even
want
one
as
a
trophy
until
Steven
pass
a
expert
eye
over
they
,
point
out
here
a
gap
,
here
a
filling
,
and
there
a
completely
misaligned
incisor
.
we
be
,
he
tell
we
,
mediocre
specimen
for
his
collection
.
it
do
not
matter
.
we
be
all

a

why

why
not

that
you
would
be
more
likely
to

and

I
never

a

.
why
do
you
choose
to
run
in
the
Republican
Party
?
my
ty
to
the
Republican
party
date
back
to
1979
,
when
I
volunteer
for
Ronald
Reagan
and
his
campaign
in
New
Hampshire
.
in
those
day
I
believe
there
be
a
difference
in
the
party
.
today
,
like
many
Americans
,
I
be
skeptical
.
I
understand
third
party
candidate
have
no
success
.
I
hope
to
lead
the
Republican
party
in
a
new
direction
for
working
class
Americans
.
how
do
you
plan
to
get
into
the
Republican
debate
and
make
a
impact
on
poll
?
in
order
to
be
invite
to
the
debate
,
we
must
raise
money
and
poll
nationally
.
this
be
a
effort
that
be
underway

recently
we
be
list
in
New
Hampshire

nationally
with

if
you
do
not
receive
the
Republican
nomination

would

consider
run
as
a
third

candidate
?
no
,
I
will
back
the
nominee
of
the
Republican

in
2016
.
after
that
,
I
may
reconsider
.
other
than
yourself
,
which
candidate
have
you
support
for
president
in
previous
campaign
?
Reagan
in
80
and
84
,
[
George
H.
W.
]
Bush
in
88
and
92
,
[
Phil

Gramm
in
96
,
[
George
W.
]
Bush
in
2000
and
,
Romney
in
08
.
What
be
your
thought
on
the
job
Barack
Obama
have
do
as
president
?
specifically
,
what
would
you
have
do
differently
?
President
Obama
have
a
agenda
that
represent
the
far
leave
wing
of
his
party
.
his
use
of
the
Presidency
to
further
this
agenda
have
in
many
way
be
unconstitutional
.
specifically
,
alter
law
once
it
be
pass
to
accommodate
his
voting
bloc
.
his
direction
to
Eric
Holder
to
enforce
some
law
and
not
other
be
another
example
.
Hill
at
the
Lesser-known
candidate
forum
in
2011
if
elect
,
what
would
constitute
a
successful
presidency
for
you
?
achieve
four
goal
:
term
limit
for
Congress
and
the
court
return
government
to
the
people
.
implement
a
tax
system

What
individual
would
you
like
to
see
in
a
Hill

I
would
like
to
bring
people
from
the

anything
else
you
would
like
to
add
?
a
final
thought
.
America

a
nation
that
will

interview
what
be
the
most
important
aspect
of
your
background
that
voter
should
know
about
?
I
be
the
only
candidate
bear
and
raise
in
Virginia
,
but
also
the
only
candidate
who
embody
both
physically
and
philosophically
the
grow
diversity
of
the
commonwealth
.
(
I
be
mixed-race
(
half-Chinese
)
and
in
a
interracial
marriage
.
)
I
be
the
only
candidate
who
have
study
both
economics
and
law
,
and
the
only
candidate
with
a
background
in
technology
entrepreneurship
.
because
of
my
academic
and
professional
background
,
I
understand
the
issue
and
challenge
face
Virginia
much
well
than
the
other
candidate
,
and
I
be
offer
real
solution
that
can
be
appreciate
across
the
political
spectrum
.
I
be
the
only
candidate
who
believe
in
both
economic
freedom
and
personal
liberty
and
the
only
candidate
who
stand
on
principle
against
cronyism
and
corporatism
and
in
favor
of
the
rule
of
law
.
what
be
your
thought
on
the
job
Bob
McDonnell
have
do
as
Governor
of
Virginia
?
what
would
you
have
do
differently
than
he
?
McDonnell
do
well
early
in
his
term
push
back
against
Senate
Democrats
who
want
huge
tax
increase
in
response
to
major
revenue
shortfall
during
the
recession
.
those
early
budget
effort
be
his
high
achievement
as
Governor
.
more
recently
,
he
err
in
accept
a
transportation
bill
that
have
huge
flaw
and
huge
tax
increase
,
rather
than
prioritizing
spending
and
seek
more
rational
,
efficient
,
decentralized
transportation
decision-making
.
he
could
have
show
much
great
leadership
in
push
for
tax
reform
,
regulatory
reform
,
and
school
choice
.
of
course
,
he
show
ethical
lapse
in
judgment
.
compare
to
previous
third
party
candidate
at
the
gubernatorial
level
,
you
have
do
exceptionally
well
in
opinion
polling
.
what
do
you
attribute
that
success
to
?
voter
see
the
two-party
system
for
the
sham
it
have
become
.
they
be
sick
of
the
partisanship
and
nonsense
and
the
total
lack
of
substance
in
modern

.
voter
see
the
two
major
party
nominee
as
exemplify
what
be
bad
about
their
respective
party
,
and
they
want
something
well
.
voter
who
meet
I
and
hear
I
speak
know
that
I
be
sincere
,
know
that
I
understand
the
issue
deeply
and
have
workable
solution
,
and
know
that
I
stand
on
principle
against
cronyism
and
corporatism
and
in
favor
of
the
rule
of
law
and
the
public
interest
.
people
like
the
fact
that
I
stand
for
a

both
open-minded
and

.
if
elect
governor
,
how
will
you
be
able
to
implement
your
agenda
while
deal
with
a
hostile
legislature
?
there
be
precedent
of
independent
governor
deal
effectively
with
the
legislature
,
and
indeed
a
wise
third-party
governor
can
have
great
effectiveness
than
a
major
party
governor
.
libertarian
share
many
policy
position
with
each
of
the
major

.
work
together
with
both
Republicans
and
Democrats
,
we
can
get
the
good
aspect
of
each
party
while
reject
the
bad
part
of
both
.
moreover
,
elect
a
third-party
governor
represent
a
repudiation
of
politics
as
usual
,
and
the
major

legislator
will
face

that

than
many
people

with

which
previous
Virginia
Governor(s)
do
you
most
admire
and
why
?
Thomas

he

be

he

the
way
,
AKMA
be
the
first
guy
I
know
of
to
do
something
like
this
,
with
Lawrence
Lessig
's
Free
Culture
.
that
,
I
think
,
start
my
thinking
about
this
,

it
take
a
while
for
the
idea
to
crystallize

do
you
personally
record
audiobooks
,
and
do
you
already
do
so
before
LibriVox
?
LibriVox
be
my
first
experience
recording
audiobooks
.
I
still
do
the
odd
chapter
,
but
I
be
a
bit
delinquent
in
finish
some
of
they
these
day
!
be
there
a
particular
LibriVox

you
think
stand
out
because
of
the
quality
,
the
overall
effort
involve
,
its
popularity
,
or
for
some
other
reason
?
my
personal
favourite
be

from

the

browse
the
catalog
,
I
find
that
the
quality
of
the
speak
audio
vary
greatly
from
text
to
text
or
even
from
chapter
to
chapter
.
if
someone
want
to
re-record
a
chapter
because
they
do
not
like
the
speaker
,
would
you
then
offer
two
version
?
yes
.
we
take
the
Wikipedia
approach
:
if
you
think
it
should
be
good
,
please
help
it
be
so
.
you
will
note
we
offer
a
couple
of
version
of
some
book
.
indeed
our
weekly
poetry
project
celebrate
this
diversity
of
voice
:
each
week
a
new
short
poem
be
choose
and
as
many
reader
as
wish
to
record
a
version
,
so
you
get
20
+
version
of
the
same
poem
,
a
very
interesting
audio
experience
.
besides
work
whose
copyright
have
expire
,
there
be
a

number
of

you
mention
Larry

,
but

also
include
some
out
of

who
be
open
to
the
concept
,
such
as
O'Reilly
.
do
you
want
to
limit
the
scope
of
LibriVox
strictly
to
old
public
domain
work
,
or
do
you
have
plan
to
include
recent
work
under
reasonably
permissive
license
as
well
?
we
be
only
do
public
domain
work
,
for
a
number
of
reason
,
partly
to
keep
simplicity
in
our
copyright
situation
--
public
domain
mean
it
be
as
simple
as
can
be
.
CC
make
thing
more
complex
.
also
,
there
be
other
site
,
notably
podiobooks.com
,
which
be
well
suit
to
CC
work
than
LibriVox
.
we
find
it
make
thing
clear
and
easy
to
say
:
publish
work
,
public
domain
,
and
leave
it
at
that
.
as
far
as
I
can
tell
,
podiobooks.com
feature
"
free
as
in
beer
"
content
—
material
which
you
can
download
,
but
which
be
not
under
a
free

license
.
instead
of
"
public
domain
"
,
would
not
"
free
content
"
work
just
as
well
,
use
something
like
the
Free
content
definition
to
limit
the
scope
?
this
need
more
discussion
obviously
:
we
choose
public
domain
because
the
text
we
use
be
public
domain
and
we
do
not
want
to
add
new
restriction
,
especially
not
non-commercial
,
since
already
our
recording
be
be
use
for
a
number
of
commercialish
project
(
I
can
not
recall
any
specific
project
name
,
but
some
pay-education
site
use
LV
stuff
)
.
that
be
good
and
well
and
fine
with
we
.
we
do
not
want
to
have
to
give
anyone
permission
to
use
our
recording
,
we
want
anyone
to
use
they
for
whatever
they
want
.
also
,
for
the
thing
to
work
you
need
to
have
many
dedicated
volunteer
willing
to
do
the
management
(
onerous
)
and
many
willing
to
do
the
reading
.
while
Pride
and
prejudice
will
attract
many
reader
,
I
do
not
know
about
O'Reilly
's
late
tome
on
XML
...
though
I
might
be
wrong

Perfect
Teeth
Steven
want
to
be
a
dentist
.
it
be
pretty
much
the
first
thing
he
tell
we
when
,
as
first
year
,
we
be
all
bunched
together
in
the
unfamiliar
dusty
classroom
.
when
,
a
couple
of
week
late
we
be
invite
over
to
his
house
we
see
that
this
be
not
a
idle
remark
.
where
our
bedroom
wall
be
decorate
with
poster
of
pop
star
and
footballer
,
Steven
have
diagram
set
out
tooth
implementation
,
anatomical
drawing
of
the
jaw
with
brightly
coloured
nerve
,
muscle
,
blood
vessel
,
bone
,
and
,
of
course
,
tooth
.
where
we
have
shelf
of
plastic
dinosaur
and
superhero
figurine
from
cornflake
box
,
Steven
have
plaster
cast
of
jawbone
,
gum
and
tooth
grin
down
at
we
.
the
instrument
be
lock
away
in
glass
cabinet
and
only
his
parent
have
the
key
.
"
they
do
not
exactly
encourage
my
interest
,
"
he
shrug
.
"
they
sort
of
tolerate
it
.
but
Dad
say
they
be
a
sort
of
collection
,
and
too
expensive
for
I
to
play
with
.
"
of
course
,
we
try
to
pick
the
lock
,
but
the
spike
and
saw
and
drillheads
remain
—
tantalisingly
—
out
of
reach
.
we
do
not
see
Steven
's
interest
as
strange
,
well
,
not
that
much
.
we
all
have
our
own
interest
—
draw
,
electronics
,
collect
beer
cap
—
that
each
appear
obscure
to
anyone
else
.
DIY
dentistry
be
just
something
that
have
never
cross
our
horizon
before
.
and
if
Steven
do
not
see
it
as
weird
,
or
no
weird
than
Andy
show
we
his
Eastern-Block
beer
cap
all
lay
out
neatly
on
cork
board
with
little
hand-written
label
,
why
should
it
bother
we
?
I
suppose
that
,
in
our
own
way
,
we
be
all
collectively
strange
.
the
bunch
that
no
one
pick
for
their
side
at
football
or
hockey
,
and
that
be
the
glue
that
hold
we
together
.
besides
,
Steven
have
some
really
good
stuff
:
sweet
that
stain
your
tooth
bright
red
—
well
,
technically
,
not
your
tooth
,
just
the
plaque
,
but
the
result
be
often
the
same
.
it
take
a
few
day
good
brush
to
get
it
off
.
well
,
most
of
it
anyway
.
he
have
effervescent
tablet
that
turn
the
canteen
drinking
water
into
that
exact
same
pink
mixture
that
the
dentist
give
you
to
rinse
your
mouth
out
after
scrape
around
inside
,
and
guarantee
to
make
the
other
kid
splutter
and
spit
it
out
when
the
taste
slowly
percolate
through
and
meet
the
memory
of
their
last
checkup
.
then
there
be
the
event
that
become
the
rite
of
passage
into
our
group
of
misfit
and
outcast
:
make
a
mould
of
your
tooth
.
it
be
inevitable
that
one
of
we
,
see
the
plaster
cast
on
the
shelf
by
Steven
's
bed
would
ask
how
they
be
do
.
it
be
just
as
inevitable
that
a
few
minute
late
,
Steven
would
be
mix
up
various
powder
and
liquid
,
and
pour
they
into
a
horse-shoe
shaped
contraption
.
it
be
not
dangerous
.
at
least
,
I
suppose
so
.
it
be
vaguely
uncomfortable
,
and
appear
sufficiently
disturbing
that
we
all
volunteer
each
other
in
turn
until
,
at
last
,
Andy
say
he
be
game
.
and
we
be
off
.
the
hard
part
be
probably
to
overcome
the
gag
reflex
that
set
in
when
you
bit
down
into
the
acrid
resin
jelly
and
it
flow
out
and
up
and
around
,
over
tooth
,
gum
and
tongue
.
your
nose
fill
with
what
you
imagine
be
fume
from
the
warm
paste
.
and
you
seem
to
be
suddenly
drown
in
your
own
saliva
.
thing
generally
get
good
when
Steven
remind
you
that
you
could
actually
breathe
,
and
swallow
,
normally
.
he
watch
the
second
hand
trot
round
the
dial
of
his
watch
mouth
the
quarter
,
before
poke
the
set
goo
to
check
its
consistency
.
then
,
when
he
give
you
the
nod
,
you
try
to
prise
your
jaw
apart
.
as
the
seal
around
your
gum
and
tooth
be
pretty
solid
,
you
think
it
would
never
come
off
,
as
the
other
giggle
at
your
expression
and
grimace
.
Steven
jiggle
the
handle
that
stick
out
beyond
your
front
tooth
like
some
metallic
duck
's
bill
,
turn
and
twist
it
most
professionally
and
murmur
encouragement
.
and
,
then
,
with
a
awful
suck
slurp
,
it
come
free
.
the
initiated
then
revel
in
retell
the
gross
sensation
of
have
this
evil-smelling
plastic
slug
invade
your
mouth
,
while
the
other
wait
their
turn
with
mixed
trepidation
and
excitement
.
raucous
laughter
greet
the
suggestion
of
the
other
body
part
that
could
receive
the
same
treatment
.
the
next
part
of
the
proceeding
be
less
thrilling
.
Steven
measure
and
mix
the
plaster
of
Paris
and
prepare
for
the
cast
by
use
a
bright
blue
putty
to
build
up
the
form
of
the
jaw
,
and
shore
up
gap
and
hole
.
it
get
even
less
exciting
when
he
say
we
will
have
to
wait
a
hour
while
the
plaster
set
real
solid
.
but
the
next
time
we
visit
his
room
we
get
to
marvel
at
our
toothy
grin
label
and
line
up
on
the
shelf
.
we
be
all
perfectly
happy
with
the
result
,
even
want
one
as
a
trophy
until
Steven
pass
a
expert
eye
over
they
,
point
out
here
a
gap
,
here
a
filling
,
and
there
a
completely
misaligned
incisor
.
we
be
,
he
tell
we
,
mediocre
specimen
for
his
collection
.
it
do
not
matter
.
we
be
all
friend
,
a
group
bond
by
the
common
experience
of
be
able
to
see
our
tooth
on

shelf

why

why
not

and

.
I
never

to
make
politics
a

.
why
do
you
choose
to
run
in
the
Republican
Party
?
my
ty
to
the
Republican
party
date
back
to
1979
,
when
I
volunteer
for
Ronald
Reagan
and
his
campaign
in
New
Hampshire
.
in
those
day
I
believe
there
be
a
difference
in
the
party
.
today
,
like
many
Americans
,
I
be
skeptical
.
I
understand
third
party
candidate
have
no
success
.
I
hope
to
lead
the
Republican
party
in
a
new
direction
for
working
class
Americans
.
how
do
you
plan
to
get
into
the
Republican
debate
and
make
a
impact
on
poll
?
in
order
to
be
invite
to
the
debate
,
we
must
raise
money
and
poll
nationally
.
this
be
a
effort
that
be
underway
.
recently
we
be
list
in
New
Hampshire
and
nationally
with
Politics1
.
if
you
do
not
receive
the
Republican
nomination
,
would
you
consider
run
as
a
third
party
candidate
?
no
,
I
will
back
the
nominee
of
the
Republican
party
in
2016
.
after
that
,
I
may
reconsider
.
other
than
yourself
,
which
candidate
have
you
support
for
president
in
previous
campaign
?
Reagan
in
80
and
84
,
[
George
H.
W.
]
Bush
in
88
and
92
,
[
Phil
]
Gramm
in
96
,
[
George
W.
]
Bush
in
2000
and
,
Romney
in
08
.
What
be
your
thought
on
the
job
Barack
Obama
have
do
as
president
?
specifically
,
what
would
you
have
do
differently
?
President
Obama
have
a
agenda
that
represent
the
far
leave
wing
of
his
party
.
his
use
of
the
Presidency
to
further
this
agenda
have
in
many
way
be
unconstitutional
.
specifically
,
alter
law
once
it
be
pass
to
accommodate
his
voting
bloc
.
his
direction
to
Eric
Holder
to
enforce
some
law
and
not
other
be
another
example
.
Hill
at
the
Lesser-known
candidate
forum
in
2011
if
elect
,
what
would
constitute
a
successful
presidency
for
you
?
achieve
four
goal
:
term
limit
for
Congress
and
the
court
return
government
to
the
people
.
implement
a
tax
system
that
allow

What
individual
would
you
like
to
see
in
a
Hill
administration
?
I
would
like
to
bring
people
from
the
heartland

anything
else
you
would
like
to
add
?
a
final
thought
.
America
be
a
nation
that
will
endure
.
I

interview
what
be
the
most
important
aspect
of
your
background
that
voter
should
know
about
?
I
be
the
only
candidate
bear
and
raise
in
Virginia
,
but
also
the
only
candidate
who
embody
both
physically
and
philosophically
the
grow
diversity
of
the
commonwealth
.
(
I
be
mixed-race
(
half-Chinese
)
and
in
a
interracial
marriage
.
)
I
be
the
only
candidate
who
have
study
both
economics
and
law
,
and
the
only
candidate
with
a
background
in
technology
entrepreneurship
.
because
of
my
academic
and
professional
background
,
I
understand
the
issue
and
challenge
face
Virginia
much
well
than
the
other
candidate
,
and
I
be
offer
real
solution
that
can
be
appreciate
across
the
political
spectrum
.
I
be
the
only
candidate
who
believe
in
both
economic
freedom
and
personal
liberty
and
the
only
candidate
who
stand
on
principle
against
cronyism
and
corporatism
and
in
favor
of
the
rule
of
law
.
what
be
your
thought
on
the
job
Bob
McDonnell
have
do
as
Governor
of
Virginia
?
what
would
you
have
do
differently
than
he
?
McDonnell
do
well
early
in
his
term
push
back
against
Senate
Democrats
who
want
huge
tax
increase
in
response
to
major
revenue
shortfall
during
the
recession
.
those
early
budget
effort
be
his
high
achievement
as
Governor
.
more
recently
,
he
err
in
accept
a
transportation
bill
that
have
huge
flaw
and
huge
tax
increase
,
rather
than
prioritizing
spending
and
seek
more
rational
,
efficient
,
decentralized
transportation
decision-making
.
he
could
have
show
much
great
leadership
in
push
for
tax
reform
,
regulatory
reform
,
and
school
choice
.
of
course
,
he
show
ethical
lapse
in
judgment
.
compare
to
previous
third
party
candidate
at
the
gubernatorial
level
,
you
have
do
exceptionally
well
in
opinion
polling
.
what
do
you
attribute
that
success
to
?
voter
see
the
two-party
system
for
the
sham
it
have
become

they
be
sick
of
the
partisanship
and
nonsense
and
the
total
lack
of

in
modern

voter
see
the
two
major

as
exemplify
what
be
bad
about
their

,
and
they
want
something

.
voter
who
meet
I
and
hear
I
speak
know
that
I
be
sincere
,
know
that
I
understand
the
issue
deeply
and
have
workable
solution
,
and
know
that
I
stand
on
principle
against
cronyism
and
corporatism
and
in
favor
of
the
rule
of

and
the
public

.
people
like
the
fact
that
I

if

governor
,
how
will
you
be
able
to
implement
your
agenda
while
deal
with
a
hostile
legislature
?
there
be
precedent
of
independent
governor
deal
effectively
with
the
legislature
,
and
indeed
a
wise
third-party
governor
can
have
great
effectiveness
than
a
major
party
governor
.
libertarian
share
many
policy
position
with
each
of
the
major

work
together
with
both
Republicans
and
Democrats
,
we
can
get
the
good
aspect
of
each
party
while
reject
the
bad
part
of
both
.
moreover
,
elect
a
third-party

represent
a
repudiation
of

,
and
the

interview
with
LibriVox
founder
Hugh
McGuire
Sunday
,
May
28
,
2006
the
LibriVox
website
feature
a
catalog
of
about
a
hundred
complete
book
,
include
book
in
other
language
like
German
,
Hebrew
,
and
Japanese
.
why
do
you
decide
to
take
the
acoustic
fate
of
public
domain
work
into
your
own
hand
,
and
how
do
you
go
about
it
?
I
think
that
a
vibrant
public
domain
be
very
important
to
a
healthy
world
,
and
so
I
think
:
here
be
a
way
to
help
the
cause
.
I
launch
LibriVox
,
emailed
some
friend
and
some
podcasters
who
be
do
literary
stuff
,
and
invite
they
to
record
a
chapter
of
Joseph
Conrad
's
Secret
Agent
.
thing
have
grow
steadily
since
.
by
the
way
,
AKMA
be
the
first
guy
I
know
of
to
do
something
like
this
,
with
Lawrence
Lessig
's
Free
Culture
.
that
,
I
think
,
start
my
thinking
about
this
,
but
it
take
a
while
for
the
idea
to
crystallize
.
Hugh
McGuire
with
some
book
that
have
not
yet
be
acoustically
liberated
.
do
you
personally
record
audiobooks
,
and
do
you
already
do
so
before
LibriVox
?
LibriVox
be
my
first
experience
recording
audiobooks
.
I
still
do
the
odd
chapter
,
but
I
be
a
bit
delinquent
in
finish
some
of
they
these
day
!
be
there
a
particular
LibriVox
book
which
you
think
stand
out
because
of
the
quality
,
the
overall
effort
involve
,
its
popularity
,
or
for
some
other
reason
?
my
personal
favourite
be
note
from
the
underground
(
Dostoyevsky
)
.
other
random
good
one
:
Austen
,
Jane
.
pride
and
prejudice
Christie
,

(

)
ed.
:
see
the
LibriVox
catalog
for
a
full
index
.
browse
the
catalog
,
I
find
that
the
quality
of
the
speak
audio
vary
greatly
from
text
to
text
or
even
from
chapter
to
chapter
.
if
someone
want
to
re-record
a
chapter
because
they
do
not
like
the
speaker
,
would
you
then
offer
two
version
?
yes
.
we
take
the
Wikipedia
approach
:
if
you
think
it
should
be
good
,
please
help
it
be
so
.
you
will
note
we
offer
a
couple
of
version
of
some
book
.
indeed
our
weekly
poetry
project
celebrate
this
diversity
of
voice
:
each
week
a
new
short
poem
be
choose
and
as
many
reader
as
wish
to
record
a
version
,
so
you
get
20
+
version
of
the
same
poem
,
a
very
interesting
audio
experience
.
besides
work
whose
copyright
have
expire
,
there
be
a
increase
number
of
modern
book
available
under
Creative
Commons
and
similar
license
.
you
mention
Larry
Lessig
's
Free
Culture
,
but
it
also
include
some
out
of
print
title
by
publisher
who
be
open
to
the
concept
,
such
as
O'Reilly
.
do
you
want
to
limit
the
scope
of
LibriVox
strictly
to
old
public
domain
work
,
or
do
you
have
plan
to
include
recent
work
under
reasonably
permissive
license
as
well
?
we
be
only
do
public
domain
work
,
for
a
number
of
reason
,
partly
to
keep
simplicity
in
our
copyright
situation
--
public
domain
mean
it
be
as
simple
as
can
be
.
CC
make
thing
more
complex
.
also
,
there
be
other
site
,
notably
podiobooks.com
,
which
be
well
suit
to
CC
work
than
LibriVox
.
we
find
it
make
thing
clear
and
easy
to
say
:
publish
work
,
public
domain
,
and
leave
it
at
that
.
as
far
as
I
can
tell
,
podiobooks.com
feature
"
free
as
in
beer
"
content
—
material
which
you
can
download
,
but
which
be
not
under
a
free
content
license
.
instead
of
"
public
domain
"
,
would
not
"
free
content
"
work
just
as
well
,
use
something
like
the
Free
content
definition
to
limit
the
scope
?
this
need
more
discussion
obviously
:
we
choose
public
domain
because
the
text
we
use
be
public
domain
and
we
do
not
want
to
add
new
restriction
,
especially
not
non-commercial
,
since
already
our
recording
be
be
use
for
a
number
of
commercialish
project
(
I
can
not
recall
any
specific
project
name
,
but
some
pay-education
site
use
LV
stuff
)
.
that
be
good
and
well
and
fine
with
we
.
we
do
not
want
to
have
to
give
anyone
permission
to
use
our
recording
,
we
want
anyone
to
use
they
for
whatever
they
want
.
also
,
for
the
thing
to
work
you
need
to
have
many
dedicated
volunteer
willing
to
do
the
management
(
onerous
)
and
many
willing
to
do
the
reading
.
while
Pride
and
prejudice
will
attract
many
reader
,
I
do
not
know
about
O'Reilly
's
late
tome
on
XML
...
though
I
might
be
wrong
.

issue
a

regard
the
rejection
of

"
like

Texans

I
be

decision
to
slight
the
Johnson
Space
Center
as
a
permanent
home
for

of
the
Space

orbiter

Houston
have
play
a
critical
role
throughout
the
life

it
be
clear
political
favors
trump
common

there
be
no

Houston
should
have

so
far

in

,
Governor
of

Chris

say
,
"
the

put
a
tremendous
amount
of
effort
into

Perfect
Teeth
Steven
want
to
be
a
dentist
.
it
be
pretty
much
the
first
thing
he
tell
we
when
,
as
first
year
,
we
be
all
bunched
together
in
the
unfamiliar
dusty
classroom
.
when
,
a
couple
of
week
late
we
be
invite
over
to
his
house
we
see
that
this
be
not
a
idle
remark
.
where
our
bedroom
wall
be
decorate
with
poster
of
pop
star
and
footballer
,
Steven
have
diagram
set
out
tooth
implementation
,
anatomical
drawing
of
the
jaw
with
brightly
coloured
nerve
,
muscle
,
blood
vessel
,
bone
,
and
,
of
course
,
tooth
.
where
we
have
shelf
of
plastic
dinosaur
and
superhero
figurine
from
cornflake
box
,
Steven
have
plaster
cast
of
jawbone
,
gum
and
tooth
grin
down
at
we
.
the
instrument
be
lock
away
in
glass
cabinet
and
only
his
parent
have
the
key
.
"
they
do
not
exactly
encourage
my
interest
,
"
he
shrug
.
"
they
sort
of
tolerate
it
.
but
Dad
say
they
be
a
sort
of
collection
,
and
too
expensive
for
I
to
play
with
.
"
of
course
,
we
try
to
pick
the
lock
,
but
the
spike
and
saw
and
drillheads
remain
—
tantalisingly
—
out
of
reach
.
we
do
not
see
Steven
's
interest
as
strange
,
well
,
not
that
much
.
we
all
have
our
own
interest
—
draw
,
electronics
,
collect
beer
cap
—
that
each
appear
obscure
to
anyone
else
.
DIY
dentistry
be
just
something
that
have
never
cross
our
horizon
before
.
and
if
Steven
do
not
see
it
as
weird
,
or
no
weird
than
Andy
show
we
his
Eastern-Block
beer
cap
all
lay
out
neatly
on
cork
board
with
little
hand-written
label
,
why
should
it
bother
we
?
I
suppose
that
,
in
our
own
way
,
we
be
all
collectively
strange
.
the
bunch
that
no
one
pick
for
their
side
at
football
or
hockey
,
and
that
be
the
glue
that
hold
we
together
.
besides
,
Steven
have
some
really
good
stuff
:
sweet
that
stain
your
tooth
bright
red
—
well
,
technically
,
not
your
tooth
,
just
the
plaque
,
but
the
result
be
often
the
same
.
it
take
a
few
day
good
brush
to
get
it
off
.
well
,
most
of
it
anyway
.
he
have
effervescent
tablet
that
turn
the
canteen
drinking
water
into
that
exact
same
pink
mixture
that
the
dentist
give
you
to
rinse
your
mouth
out
after
scrape
around
inside
,
and
guarantee
to
make
the
other
kid
splutter
and
spit
it
out
when
the
taste
slowly
percolate
through
and
meet
the
memory
of
their
last
checkup
.
then
there
be
the
event
that
become
the
rite
of
passage
into
our
group
of
misfit
and
outcast
:
make
a
mould
of
your
tooth
.
it
be
inevitable
that
one
of
we
,
see
the
plaster
cast
on
the
shelf
by
Steven
's
bed
would
ask
how
they
be
do
.
it
be
just
as
inevitable
that
a
few
minute
late
,
Steven
would
be
mix
up
various
powder
and
liquid
,
and
pour
they
into
a
horse-shoe
shaped
contraption
.
it
be
not
dangerous
.
at
least
,
I
suppose
so
.
it
be
vaguely
uncomfortable
,
and
appear
sufficiently
disturbing
that
we
all
volunteer
each
other
in
turn
until
,
at
last
,
Andy
say
he
be
game
.
and
we
be
off
.
the
hard
part
be
probably
to
overcome
the
gag
reflex
that
set
in
when
you
bit
down
into
the
acrid
resin
jelly
and
it
flow
out
and
up
and
around
,
over
tooth
,
gum
and
tongue
.
your
nose
fill
with
what
you
imagine
be
fume
from
the
warm
paste
.
and
you
seem
to
be
suddenly
drown
in
your
own
saliva
.
thing
generally
get
good
when
Steven
remind
you
that
you
could
actually
breathe
,
and
swallow
,
normally
.
he
watch
the
second
hand
trot
round
the
dial
of
his
watch
mouth
the
quarter
,
before
poke
the
set
goo
to
check
its
consistency
.
then
,
when
he
give
you
the
nod
,
you
try
to
prise
your
jaw
apart
.
as
the
seal
around
your
gum
and
tooth
be
pretty
solid
,
you
think
it
would
never
come
off
,
as
the
other
giggle
at
your
expression
and
grimace
.
Steven
jiggle
the
handle
that
stick
out
beyond
your
front
tooth
like
some
metallic
duck
's
bill
,
turn
and
twist
it
most
professionally
and
murmur
encouragement
.
and
,
then
,
with
a
awful
suck
slurp
,
it
come
free
.
the
initiated
then
revel
in
retell
the
gross
sensation
of
have
this
evil-smelling
plastic
slug
invade
your
mouth
,
while
the
other
wait
their
turn
with
mixed
trepidation
and
excitement
.
raucous
laughter
greet
the
suggestion
of
the
other
body
part
that
could
receive
the
same
treatment
.
the
next
part
of
the
proceeding
be
less
thrilling
.
Steven
measure
and
mix
the
plaster
of
Paris
and
prepare
for
the
cast
by
use
a
bright
blue
putty
to
build
up
the
form
of
the
jaw
,
and
shore
up
gap
and
hole
.
it
get
even
less
exciting
when
he
say
we
will
have
to
wait
a
hour
while
the
plaster
set
real
solid
.
but
the
next
time
we
visit
his
room
we
get
to
marvel
at
our
toothy
grin
label
and
line
up
on
the
shelf
.
we
be
all
perfectly
happy
with
the
result
,
even
want
one
as
a
trophy
until
Steven
pass
a
expert
eye
over
they
,
point
out
here
a
gap
,
here
a
filling
,
and
there
a
completely
misaligned
incisor
.
we
be
,
he
tell
we
,
mediocre
specimen
for
his
collection
.
it
do
not
matter
.
we
be
all
friend
,
a
group
bond
by
the
common
experience
of
be
able
to
see
our
tooth
on

shelf

why
not

I

why
do
you
choose
to
run
in
the
Republican
Party
?
my
ty
to
the
Republican
party
date
back
to
1979
,
when
I
volunteer
for
Ronald
Reagan
and
his
campaign
in
New
Hampshire
.
in
those
day
I
believe
there
be
a
difference
in
the
party
.
today
,
like
many
Americans
,
I
be
skeptical
.
I
understand
third
party
candidate
have
no
success
.
I
hope
to
lead
the
Republican
party
in
a
new
direction
for
working
class
Americans
.
how
do
you
plan
to
get
into
the
Republican
debate
and
make
a
impact
on
poll
?
in
order
to
be
invite
to
the
debate
,
we
must
raise
money
and
poll
nationally

this
be
a
effort
that
be

recently
we
be

in

if
you

not
receive
the

would

as
a
third

candidate
?
no
,
I
will
back
the
nominee
of
the
Republican

in

.
after
that
,
I
may
reconsider
.
other
than
yourself
,
which
candidate
have
you
support
for
president
in
previous
campaign
?
Reagan
in
80
and
84
,
[
George
H.
W.
]
Bush
in
88
and
92
,
[
Phil

Gramm
in
96
,
[
George
W.
]
Bush
in
2000
and
,
Romney
in
08
.
What
be
your
thought
on
the
job
Barack
Obama
have
do
as
president
?
specifically
,
what
would
you
have
do
differently
?
President
Obama
have
a
agenda
that
represent
the
far
leave
wing
of
his
party
.
his
use
of
the
Presidency
to
further
this
agenda
have
in
many
way
be
unconstitutional
.
specifically
,
alter
law
once
it
be
pass
to
accommodate
his
voting
bloc
.
his
direction
to
Eric
Holder
to
enforce
some
law
and
not
other
be
another
example
.
Hill
at
the
Lesser-known
candidate
forum
in
2011
if
elect
,
what
would
constitute
a
successful
presidency
for
you
?
achieve
four
goal
:
term
limit
for
Congress
and
the
court
return
government
to
the
people
.
implement
a
tax
system
that
allow

What
individual
would
you
like
to
see
in
a
Hill
administration
?
I
would
like
to
bring
people
from
the
heartland

anything
else
you
would
like
to
add
?
a
final
thought
.
America

a
nation
that
will

interview
what
be
the
most
important
aspect
of
your
background
that
voter
should
know
about
?
I
be
the
only
candidate
bear
and
raise
in
Virginia
,
but
also
the
only
candidate
who
embody
both
physically
and
philosophically
the
grow
diversity
of
the
commonwealth
.
(
I
be
mixed-race
(
half-Chinese
)
and
in

interracial
marriage
.
)
I
be
the
only
candidate
who
have
study
both
economics
and
law
,
and
the
only
candidate
with
a
background
in
technology
entrepreneurship
.
because
of
my
academic
and
professional
background
,
I
understand
the
issue
and
challenge
face
Virginia
much
well
than
the
other
candidate
,
and
I
be
offer
real
solution
that
can
be
appreciate
across
the
political
spectrum
.
I
be
the
only
candidate
who
believe
in
both
economic
freedom
and
personal
liberty
and
the
only
candidate
who
stand
on
principle
against
cronyism
and
corporatism

in

of
the
rule
of
law
.
what
be
your
thought
on
the
job
Bob
McDonnell
have
do
as
Governor

?
what
would
you
have

than
he
?
McDonnell
do
well
early
in
his
term
push
back
against
Senate
Democrats
who
want
huge
tax
increase
in
response
to
major
revenue
shortfall
during
the
recession
.
those
early
budget
effort
be
his
high
achievement
as
Governor
.
more
recently
,
he
err
in
accept
a
transportation
bill
that
have
huge
flaw
and
huge
tax
increase
,
rather
than
prioritizing
spending
and
seek
more
rational
,
efficient
,
decentralized
transportation
decision-making
.
he
could
have
show
much
great
leadership
in
push
for
tax
reform
,
regulatory
reform
,
and
school
choice
.
of
course
,
he
show
ethical
lapse
in
judgment

moreover
,

interview
with
LibriVox
founder
Hugh

Sunday
,
May

2006
the
LibriVox
website
feature
a
catalog
of
about
a
hundred
complete
book
,
include
book
in
other
language
like
German
,
Hebrew
,
and
Japanese
.
why
do
you
decide
to
take
the
acoustic
fate
of
public
domain
work
into
your
own
hand
,
and
how
do
you
go
about
it
?
I
think
that
a
vibrant
public
domain
be
very
important
to
a
healthy
world
,
and
so
I
think
:
here
be
a
way
to
help
the
cause
.
I
launch
LibriVox
,
emailed
some
friend
and
some
podcasters
who
be
do
literary
stuff
,
and
invite
they
to
record
a
chapter
of
Joseph
Conrad
's
Secret
Agent
.
thing
have
grow
steadily
since
.
by
the
way
,
AKMA
be
the
first
guy
I
know
of
to
do
something
like
this
,
with
Lawrence
Lessig
's
Free
Culture
.
that
,
I
think
,
start
my
thinking
about
this
,
but
it
take
a
while
for
the
idea
to
crystallize
.
Hugh
McGuire
with
some
book
that
have
not
yet
be
acoustically
liberated
.
do
you
personally
record
audiobooks
,
and
do
you
already
do
so
before
LibriVox
?
LibriVox
be
my
first
experience
recording
audiobooks
.
I
still
do
the
odd
chapter
,
but
I
be
a
bit
delinquent
in
finish
some
of
they
these
day
!
be
there
a
particular
LibriVox
book
which
you
think
stand
out
because
of
the
quality
,
the
overall
effort
involve
,
its
popularity
,
or
for
some
other
reason
?
my
personal
favourite
be
note
from
the
underground
(
Dostoyevsky
)
.
other
random
good
one
:
Austen
,
Jane
.
pride
and

(

)
ed.
:
see
the
LibriVox
catalog
for
a
full
index
.
browse
the
catalog
,
I
find
that
the
quality
of
the
speak
audio
vary
greatly
from
text
to
text
or
even
from
chapter
to
chapter
.
if
someone
want
to
re-record
a
chapter
because
they
do
not
like
the
speaker
,
would
you
then
offer
two
version
?
yes
.
we
take
the
Wikipedia
approach
:
if
you
think
it
should
be
good
,
please
help
it
be
so
.
you
will
note
we
offer
a
couple
of
version
of
some
book
.
indeed
our
weekly
poetry
project
celebrate
this
diversity
of
voice
:
each
week
a
new
short
poem
be
choose
and
as
many
reader
as
wish
to
record
a
version
,
so
you
get
20
+
version
of
the
same
poem
,
a
very
interesting
audio
experience
.
besides
work
whose
copyright
have
expire
,
there
be
a
increase
number
of
modern
book
available
under
Creative
Commons
and
similar
license
.
you
mention
Larry
Lessig
's
Free
Culture
,
but
it
also
include
some
out
of
print
title
by
publisher
who
be
open
to
the
concept
,
such
as
O'Reilly
.
do
you
want
to
limit
the
scope
of
LibriVox
strictly
to
old
public
domain
work
,
or
do
you
have
plan
to
include
recent
work
under
reasonably
permissive
license
as
well
?
we
be
only
do
public
domain
work
,
for
a
number
of
reason
,
partly
to
keep
simplicity
in
our
copyright
situation
--
public
domain
mean
it
be
as
simple
as
can
be
.
CC
make
thing
more
complex
.
also
,
there
be
other
site
,
notably
podiobooks.com
,
which
be
well
suit
to
CC
work
than
LibriVox
.
we
find
it
make
thing
clear
and
easy
to
say
:
publish
work
,
public
domain
,
and
leave
it
at
that
.
as
far
as
I
can
tell
,
podiobooks.com
feature
"
free
as
in
beer
"
content
—
material
which
you
can
download
,
but
which
be
not
under
a
free
content
license
.
instead
of
"
public
domain
"
,
would
not
"
free
content
"
work
just
as
well
,
use
something
like
the
Free
content
definition
to
limit
the
scope
?
this
need
more
discussion
obviously
:
we
choose
public
domain
because
the
text
we
use
be
public
domain
and
we
do
not
want
to
add
new
restriction
,
especially
not
non-commercial
,
since
already
our
recording
be
be
use
for
a
number
of
commercialish
project
(
I
can
not
recall
any
specific
project
name
,
but
some
pay-education
site
use
LV
stuff
)
.
that
be
good
and
well
and
fine
with
we
.
we
do
not
want
to
have
to
give
anyone
permission
to
use
our
recording
,
we
want
anyone
to
use
they
for
whatever
they
want
.
also
,
for
the
thing
to
work
you
need
to
have
many
dedicated
volunteer
willing
to
do
the
management
(
onerous
)
and
many
willing
to
do
the
reading
.
while
Pride
and
prejudice
will
attract
many
reader
,
I
do
not
know
about
O'Reilly
's
late
tome
on
XML
...
though
I
might
be
wrong
.
